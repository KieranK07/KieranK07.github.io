This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website and a multiplayer first-person shooter (FPS) game.

## Portfolio Website (Barebones Template)

The portfolio website files (`index.html`, `css/style.css`, `js/main.js`) have been converted into a barebones template. They provide a minimal starting point for a web project with basic HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality.

To run the website locally, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Multiplayer FPS Game

The multiplayer FPS game is built with Three.js and Firebase. It is a simple game where players can run around and shoot each other.

To run the game locally, you will need to have a web server running. You can use any web server you like, but I recommend using the `http-server` package from npm.

To install `http-server`, run the following command:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

Once you have `http-server` installed, you can run the game by running the following command in the root of the repository:

```
http-server
```

This will start a web server on port 8080. You can then open the game by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/multiplayer_fps_game.html` in your web browser.
