# Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for a software developer and hardware hacker. It is a single-page application built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It also uses Three.js for 3D graphics and some interactive elements. The website is hosted on GitHub Pages.

The repository also contains a multiplayer first-person shooter game built with Three.js and Firebase.

# Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main entry point for the portfolio website.
*   `multiplayer_fps_game.html`: The entry point for the multiplayer FPS game.
*   `README.md`: The original README file for the repository.
*   `CNAME`: Contains the custom domain for the GitHub Pages site.

# Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website locally, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling and standard JavaScript for interactivity. The code is well-structured and includes comments to explain complex logic.
